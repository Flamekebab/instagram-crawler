I made a start on this but ultimately had to put it on hold as a load of other stuff came up at work. It got to the point where I was reasonably happy with the core function although I seem to recall that the resume function never worked properly, for whatever reason.

It doesn't actually need proxies to run but I'm told that running this sort of thing too often will flag the account it's logging in as. Pretty obvious stuff but I didn't need the proxy stuff until the core code worked properly. It was yielding results that would have been quite handy.
